# Markov Chain Generator

This project was developed as part of my C/C++ Workshop course.
It implements a generic Markov Chain in C, which learns from a given text corpus and generates new strings by building a chain of words and their successors.

Two example applications are included:
- `tweets`: generates random tweets from a corpus
- `snakes_and_ladders`: generates random paths through a board game using Markov chains

## Note
This repository is kept as-is from the course exercise, without further polishing.
