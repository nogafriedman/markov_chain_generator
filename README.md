# Markov Chain Generator (University Assignment)

This project was developed as part of my C/C++ Workshop course.  
It implements a generic Markov Chain in C, with two applications:
- `tweets`: generates random tweets from a corpus
- `snakes_and_ladders`: generates random paths through a board game using Markov chains

## Note
This repository is kept as-is from the course exercise, without further polishing.
